# Chat Application

This is a full-fledged chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It features real-time communication using WebSockets and incorporates additional technologies such as React Toastify for notifications, JSON Web Tokens for authentication, and password encryption for enhanced security.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: Database for storing chat messages and user information
- Express.js: Backend framework for handling API requests and routes
- React.js: Frontend library for building the user interface
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side code
- WebSockets: Protocol for enabling real-time communication between client and server
- React Toastify: Library for displaying notifications in the React app
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Mechanism for secure authentication
- Encryption: Used for password encryption to ensure user data security
